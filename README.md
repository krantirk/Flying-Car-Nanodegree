### Basic Information about the Flying Car Nanodegree

Master autonomous flight software engineering skills as you learn about drone robotics, develop sophisticated flying car systems, and write real code for real aircraft.

**Why Take This Nanodegree Program?**


*In this program, you’ll learn from world-class experts, write aircraft-ready code, and tackle real-world challenges ranging from emergency aid to fleet coordination. You’ll master controls, planning, and more. In an increasingly congested world, flying cars look to the skies to provide smart transportation solutions that benefit us all.*
